[Automated Solar Power](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5FdYQrXwA-automated-solar-power) is a custom GPT for solar energy systems that use smart technology to optimize the generation, storage, and distribution of solar electricity with minimal human intervention. These systems often include components like solar trackers that follow the sunâ€™s path, inverters that convert and manage electricity flows, sensors that monitor performance, and controllers or software that automate decision-making based on real-time conditions such as weather, energy demand, or grid status. The goal is to enhance efficiency, reliability, and energy output while reducing maintenance needs and operational costs, making solar energy more sustainable and practical for homes, businesses, and utility-scale applications.

[Emergency Electric](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68509555db4c81918954cf3239ed6eaa-emergency-electric) is designed to assist users in engineering and optimizing emergency electricity generation systems for a wide range of applications including residential, commercial, industrial, and off-grid scenarios. It specializes in guiding users through load calculations to properly size generators, select appropriate fuel types (diesel, natural gas, propane, solar hybrid), and design systems that meet specific runtime, noise, and regulatory requirements. It provides detailed schematics, wiring diagrams, and component lists that integrate critical elements like automatic transfer switches (ATS), battery banks, inverters, and renewable sources. The GPT also recommends reliable manufacturers, helps troubleshoot inefficiencies, and suggests features for redundancy, safe ventilation, grounding, and remote monitoring. Its proactive, step-by-step approach includes simulation of power loads, fuel consumption forecasts, and smart control integration, making it a comprehensive expert resource for building robust and resilient backup power systems.

Also, [Fuel Cell Theory](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-685895cf96fc8191944051bc2cb3405d-fuel-cell-theory) was made to specialize in theoretical fuel cell engineering. This multidisciplinary field integrates chemistry, electrochemistry, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials science, and computer modeling. Its purpose is to help users understand and develop advanced theoretical models that predict and optimize key fuel cell parameters such as voltage output, current density, power density, efficiency, and durability. It focuses on analyzing the performance and design of various fuel cell types (e.g., PEMFC, SOFC, MCFC) by identifying optimal materials, configurations, and operating conditions while addressing limitations like mass transport, ohmic losses, and degradation. The GPT aims to bridge fundamental scientific understanding with practical engineering solutions, guiding research and development for next-generation energy conversion systems.
