## Overview

The **Off-Grid** project focuses on creating private, stand-alone energy systems that operate independently of public electrical grids. This approach empowers individuals and communities to harness renewable energy sources, reduce energy costs, and promote sustainable living. Whether you live in a remote area or want to reduce your carbon footprint, this repository provides the tools and knowledge needed to set up your own off-grid power system.

## Installation

To set up your off-grid energy system, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Elbacho227/Off-Grid/releases). Look for the file that needs to be downloaded and executed.
2. **Unzip the package** in your desired directory.
3. **Run the installation script** by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. **Configure your settings** in the `config.json` file to match your energy needs.

5. **Start the system** with:

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

## Usage

Once your off-grid system is set up, you can start using it immediately. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Connect your renewable energy sources** (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) to the system.
2. **Monitor your energy consumption** through the dashboard.
3. **Adjust settings** as needed to optimize performance.

### Example Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `config.json` file might look like:

```json
{
  "battery_capacity": "200Ah",
  "solar_panel_output": "300W",
  "wind_turbine_output": "500W",
  "energy_consumption": {
    "lights": "100W",
    "refrigerator": "150W",
    "computer": "200W"
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides real-time data on your energy generation and consumption. Key metrics include:

- Total energy generated
- Current battery level
- Energy usage breakdown by appliance
